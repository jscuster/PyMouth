# PyMouth
A pure python implementation of SAM, Software Automatic Mouth.

This is a port from the version that Sebastian Macke ported from 6502 assembly to C.

 It is a tiny, fast speech synthesizer, able to run on a 6502-based computer like the C64. I've decided to give this a shot because I'm curious to see if python has enough grunt to handle this algorithm.

## License

This code is released under the Unlicense. The concept, however is not mine, and therefore cannot be licensed by me. The company that created SAM no longer exists. For this and other reasons, you should be able to use the software in your projects, but I am *not* a lawyer, so use at your own risk.

##Docs

As this is my first commit on this project, I encourage you to visit the (original version.)[https://github.com/s-macke/SAM]
